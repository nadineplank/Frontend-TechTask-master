These are my open TODOes:

- Improve test coverage
- Add unit tests for components
- Add test utilites and mocks
- Implement integration tests for the full product list flow with playwright
- Add tests for error states and loading states
- Implement sorting and filterting if API would allow
- Implement actual add to cart functionality (even if just local state)
- Add skeletons for loading states
- Considered using Styled System, but under the website (https://styled-system.com/) is no documentation
